Q-8 : In how many ways can a CSS be integrated as a web page?

=> Inline Styles :
	-> CSS styles can be applied directly within the HTML elements using the style attribute.
	
=> Internal/Embedded Styles :
	-> CSS can be placed directly within the HTML file using the <style> tag in the head section.
	
=> External Styles :
	-> CSS can be stored in a separate file (e.g., styles.css) and linked to the HTML file using the <link> tag.
